# Smoke / Fluid Simulation

![Smoke Simulation Banner](https://github.com/michal102/Smoke-Simulator/blob/main/gallery/%7B6D82977D-94B8-47E5-88DA-7D25509EE792%7D.png)

A real-time fluid and smoke simulation built in Unity.  
This repository contains the source code for the simulation.

The simulation is based on the Navierâ€“Stokes equations for fluid dynamics, solved using the **Jacobi iterative method**.  
All computations are performed on the GPU as a HLSL compute shader.

## Demo
A **compiled build** is available here:
